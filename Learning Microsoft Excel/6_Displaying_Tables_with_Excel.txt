--Displaying Tables with Excel

To know if a matrix is a "Table" identified by excel, click on that matrix and see if a "Table Design" tab shows at top right.
if not, then select the whole matrix -> go to Insert tab -> click on table or.. shortcut -> ctrl + t
to rename the name go to table design-> edit the table name at top left corner

--- Use table name to perform quick calculations
if table name is fruit and it has a column "Quantity" of which we need sum
#=SUM(fruits[Quantity]) would give correct result

-- to check list of created named ranges
format tab -> name manager

--use custom sort in table to sort multiple columns 
	sort and filter -> custom sort
	
-- Waterfall chart
This chart is basically used to display the running total of a value across multiple categories
