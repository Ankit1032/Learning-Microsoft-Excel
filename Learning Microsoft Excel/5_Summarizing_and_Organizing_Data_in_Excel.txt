--- Grouping and Outlining Data
# We group and outline data to make the unstructured data into structured 
# Group is grouping/organizing the data either region wise, gender wise or any column value wise
#Outlining allows us to create groups within groups

-- Rules for Applying Groups & Outlines
#There must be a common grouping criteria
#The data must be sorted by the grouped item
#You are going to have to insert some blank rows to act as a seperator between the groups

# you can also use "Subtotal" to find sum/count/avg og each group
