1. MATCH
#MATCH is an Excel function that searches for a value in an array and returns the position of that value within the array.

#=MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type])

lookup_value: The value you want to search for.

lookup_array: The range of cells that you want to search within.

match_type: Optional. Specifies how the function should match the lookup_value with the values in the lookup_array. The available options are 1, 0, or -1.

1 or omitted: Finds the largest value that is less than or equal to lookup_value. This is also known as "approximate match" or "sorted order".
0: Finds the first value that is exactly equal to lookup_value. This is also known as "exact match".
-1: Finds the smallest value that is greater than or equal to lookup_value. This is also known as "approximate match" or "reverse sorted order".

2. INDEX
INDEX is an Excel function that returns the value of a cell within a specified range based on the row and column number.

=INDEX(array, row_num, [column_num])

3. Difference between Vlookup and Hlookup
VLOOKUP searches for a value in the leftmost column of a table and returns a value in the same row from a column you specify. It is commonly used to look up information in a table, such as a product code or customer name, and return related information, such as a product description or customer address.

HLOOKUP, on the other hand, searches for a value in the first row of a table and returns a value in the same column from a row you specify. It is less commonly used than VLOOKUP, but can be helpful when you need to look up values based on column headings.

=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])

=HLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, row_index_num, [range_lookup])
