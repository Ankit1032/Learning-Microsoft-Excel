=====DATA VALIDATION
#Data Validation in Excel lets you control the data that can be entered in a cell
#Three ways validation is used:
1. Restrict data to certain numbers/text/data
2. Inform user whenever the out-of-range data is entered
3. Guide user on what data to entered

Note: Data validation is destroyed if a user copies data from a cell without validation to a cell with data validation, the validation is destroyed/replaced

=====What-If Analysis
#What-If Analysis is an Excel tool that lets you explore results of different scenarios by using several sets of values in one or more formulas

#Types of What-If Analysis Tools
1. Scenario Manager
2. Data Table
3. Goal Seek

#In Scenario Manager and Data Table, you change the input variables and see what impact it has on the output. These can help answer questions like what would happen to our profits if the number of units we sell doubles.

#As for Goal Seek, suppose you have a particular outcome you would like to achieve. Using Goal Seek you can ask Excel to calculate what change the input would be required to achieve the outcome. This can answer questions like how many units of products need to be sold in order to reach a desired profit level.
